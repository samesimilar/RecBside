=========================
Please note the information below is included mainly for purposes of attribution.
To build this project on the Organelle synth, you only need to run "make all" on 
the command line in this folder, and pd-lib-builder takes care of the configuration.

You can find the upstream, cross-platform, complete source code for [hid] in the
pd-extended collection: https://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended

=========================

BINARIES
--------

There are two included binaries:

hid.pd_darwin = Darwin/PowerPC and Mac OS X
hid.pd_linux = Linux/PowerPC



COMPILING
---------

The compiler needs to know where the Pd source is to find the headers, and the
linker needs to know where the Pd binary is to check symbols.  You can either
set these on the command line or edit the Makefile

  make INCLUDE=/path/to/pd/src PDEXECUTABLE=/path/to/pd/bin/pd

On GNU/Linux, this is likely to look like:

  make INCLUDE=/usr/local/src/pd-0.38-2/src PDEXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/pd

On Darwin/Mac OS X, this is like to look like:

  make INCLUDE=/usr/local/src/pd/src PDEXECUTABLE=/Applications/Pd.app/Contents/Resources/bin/pd



COMPILING A DEBUG VERSION
-------------------------

To compile a debug version, edit these lines in hid.c (about line 32):

//#define DEBUG(x)
#define DEBUG(x) x 

Swap the commented lines so it looks like the lines above then recompile.


INSTALL
-------

To install, you can add these lines to your .pdrc:

-path /path/to/hid-0.5
-helppath /path/to/hid-0.5

Or you can copy the files to another place:

mv *-help.pd examples/*.pd /path/to/doc/5.reference
mv *.pd *.pd_* /path/to/extra
